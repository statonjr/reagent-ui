# Reagent UI
This is a testing ground for UI components build using Reagent
*Note* I am not familiar with `Clojure`, `React` or `Hiccup`. This will likely be a hot mess. Suggestions welcome!

## Running the project
To run this project open `2` terminal windows. In one window run the following:

`lein run`

*I think: This method runs the code*

In the other window, run the following:

`lein figwheel`

*I think: This method watches for updates and recompiles the ClojureScript*

(Reagent Project)[https://github.com/reagent-project] is a fantasic resource and was what I'm working from.

Thanks
