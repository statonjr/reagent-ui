# Reagent UI
This is a testing ground for UI components build using Reagent

*Note* I am not familiar with `Clojure`, `React` or `Hiccup`. This will likely be a hot mess. Suggestions welcome!

## Running the project
To run this project open a terminal window and `cd` into the project directory. Run the following:

`lein figwheel`

Point your browser to [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/)

[Reagent Project](https://github.com/reagent-project) is a fantasic resource and is what I'm working from.

Also, I'm using [Foundation](http://www.foundation.zurb.com/) for the theme.

Thanks
